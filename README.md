# powerups
Power-Ups are a collection of single-game save state editors and cheating utilities. They're each designed to edit 1-2 things from a specific game. These are too complicated to fit into [Hapsby](https://github.com/huguesjohnson/hapsby) but not something worth a whole big project. The first three were originally written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) and later converted to Java. Hypothetical future ones would likely be in Java.

Projects in this repository:

* Falcone: Hit Point & Inventory Editor for Order of the Griffon
* Hilary: handling.cfg Editor for Grand Theft Auto Vice City
* Luise: Phantasy Star III Event Editor

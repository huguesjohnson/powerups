# powerups
Power-Ups are a collection of single-game save state editors and cheating utilities. They're each designed to edit a single aspect from a specific game. They're things that are too complicated to fit into Hapsby but not something I want to devote a huge Aridia-like effort for. They're all hastily written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) and open source.

Projects in this repository:
